# The program generates a random number from 1 to 10, or 1 to 100 any range that is specified and the user must guess the number after a hint # from the computer. 
# Every time a userâ€™s guess is wrong they are prompted with more hints to make it easier for them to guess the number but 
# at the cost of reducing the score. The clue any math clue like multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.
